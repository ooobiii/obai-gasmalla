### Project Overview

As a Machine Learning Engineer for Network Rail’s Structures Workflows project, I contributed to enhancing their systems by developing an advanced NLP-based pipeline. This project was aimed at automating the handling of textual data and optimizing workflow processes using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 

*While the data for this project is classified, I am available to discuss the project in more detail if needed.*

### Key Achievements

- **Client Feedback**: Received a 10/10 feedback rating from the client for the quality of work delivered.
- **Star Award**: Recognized with a Star Award for my pivotal role in the project. My dedication to research, timely delivery, and hands-on support for cutting-edge NLP work was highly commended.

    *“Obai has been playing a pivotal role in the project. The Network Rail Machine Learning work is valuable to ITS, and this is the first time we are venturing into the Data Science/Machine Learning field. His dedication and timely delivery on research and hands-on support for some of the cutting-edge NLP work has been commendable. Obai has reacted to the ever-changing demands of the project, increasing his efforts when necessary to manage deadlines. His commitment and tenacity have ensured that we are trusted technical experts for the business, and we have been considered for further project phases as well. A job well done. Thank you, Obai!”*

### Contribution and Impact

- Developed and implemented an NLP-based solution to automate the processing of large volumes of unstructured data, significantly improving workflow efficiency.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to support the integration of Machine Learning within the organization, making it the first time Network Rail ventured into Data Science/Machine Learning.
- Ensured the delivery of scalable, robust solutions that set the foundation for future phases of the project, helping the team secure additional project support.

This project was instrumental in positioning our team as trusted technical experts in Data Science and Machine Learning within the organization.

This project involved NLP, data processing, and workflow optimization for a high-profile client in the infrastructure domain.
